        <h2>A Special Letter for You</h2>
        <p>Dear Elysian,</p>
        <p>On this special day, I want to take a moment to wish you the happiest of birthdays and thank you for being such an important part of my life. You’ve been my number one supporter and, at the same time, my number one basher and always keeping me grounded, challenging me, and pushing me to grow in ways I never expected.
Thank you for being such an amazing friend, for always being there for me, and for taking care of me even when I might not always say how much I appreciate it. You’ve stood by my side during my lowest moments, offering your quiet strength, words of advice and support when I needed it most. I can’t tell you how much that means to me.
I know you’re not always the biggest fan of physical touch, but it truly means the world to me that you let me hug you and show affection in my own way. It’s those small gestures that remind me just how special our bond is.
Honestly, I never thought we’d become as close as we are now. I always imagined we’d just stay casual friends, but here we are, sharing moments, laughter, and memories that mean so much to me. Thank you for sticking around and for putting up with my playfulness, my loudness, and my occasional craziness. Your patience and understanding never go unnoticed, and I feel so lucky to have someone like you in my life.
On your birthday, I hope you know how loved and appreciated you are not just by me but by everyone who’s lucky enough to know you. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I hope this year brings you countless blessings, amazing memories, and everything your heart desires.</p>
        <p>Warm wishes,</p>
        <p>Lian</p>
